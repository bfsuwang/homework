        <p><span class="head">Macroeconomic Schools of Thought</span><br>
        The field of macroeconomics is organized into many different schools of thought, with differing views on how the markets and their participants operate.</p>
        <p><span>Classical </span><br>
        Classical economists hold that prices, wages, and rates are flexible and markets always clear, building on Adam Smith's original theories.</p>
        <p><span>Keynesian</span><br>
        Keynesian economics was largely founded on the basis of the works of John Maynard Keynes, the most famous among which is the book <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>. <br>

            <div>John Maynard Keynes, whose book <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i> is regarded as the pioneering work in modern macroeconomics.</div>
        </div><br>
        <p>When the Great Depression struck, classical economists had difficulty explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed. In classical theory, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold. Keynes offered a new theory of economics that explained why markets might not clear, which would evolve (later in the 20th century) into a group of macroeconomic schools of thought known as Keynesian economics. Keynesians focus on aggregate demand as the principal factor in issues like unemployment and the business cycle. Keynesian economists believe that the business cycle can be managed by active government intervention through fiscal policy (spending more in recessions to stimulate demand) and monetary policy (stimulating demand with lower interest rates).</p>
        <p><span>Monetarist</span><br>
        The Monetarist school is largely credited to the works of Milton Friedman. He argued that the role of money in the economy was sufficient to explain the Great Depression, and that aggregate demand oriented explanations were not necessary.<br>

            <img src="images/Friedman.jpg" width="750px"><br>
            <div>Milton Friedman, an American economist, was one of the leaders from the Chicago school of economics. He received the 1976 Nobel Prize in Economics.

        <p>Friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, Friedman doubted the government's ability to "fine-tune" the economy with monetary policy. He generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.</p>
        <p><span>Neoclassical</span><br>
        Neoclassical economics assumes that people have rational expectations and strive to maximize their utility. This school presumes that people act independently on the basis of all the information they can attain. The idea of marginalism and maximizing marginal utility is attributed to the neoclassical school, as well as the notion that economic agents act on the basis of rational expectations.</p>
        <p><span>Austrian</span><br>
        The Austrian School is an older school of economics that is seeing some resurgence in popularity, the most famous scholar from this school is Friedrich Hayek. <br>
            
        <div class="sub_img">
            <img src="images/Hayek.jpg" width="750px"><br>
            <div>Friedrich August von Hayek, often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist. He was one of the laureates of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Economics.

        </div><br>
            
        <p>Austrian school economists believe that human behavior is too idiosyncratic to model accurately with mathematics and that minimal government intervention is best. The Austrian school has contributed useful theories and explanations on the business cycle, implications of capital intensity, and the importance of time and opportunity costs in determining consumption and value.</p>
