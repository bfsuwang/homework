        <p><span class="head">Basic Macroeconomic Concepts</span><br>
        Macroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but there are three central topics for macroeconomic research. Macroeconomic theories usually relate the phenomena of output, unemployment, and inflation.</p>
        <p><span>Output and income</span><br>
        National output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given period of time. Everything that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income. Macroeconomic output is usually measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The output and income are usually considered equivalent and the two terms are often used interchangeably. Output can be viewed from the production side and measured as the total value of final goods and services or the sum of all value added in the economy. Advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital, and better education and human capital are all factors that lead to increased economic output over time.</p>
        <p><span>Unemployment</span><br>
        The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e. the percentage of workers without jobs in the labor force. The unemployment rate in the labor force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded.</p>
        <p><span>Inflation and deflation</span><br>
        A general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation. When prices decrease, there is deflation. Economists measure these changes in prices with price indexes. Inflation can occur when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly. Similarly, a declining economy can lead to deflation. Raising interest rates or reducing the supply of money in an economy will reduce inflation. Inflation can lead to increased uncertainty and other negative consequences. Deflation can lower economic output.</p>
