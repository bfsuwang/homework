        <p><span class="head">Macroeconomic Policy</span><br>
        Macroeconomic policy is usually implemented through two sets of tools: fiscal and monetary policy. Both forms of policy are used to stabilize the economy, which can mean boosting the economy to the level of GDP consistent with full employment.</p>
        <p><span>Monetary policy</span><br>
        Monetary policy is made by central banks. A central bank is an institution that manages the currency, money supply, and interest rates of a state or formal monetary union, and oversees their commercial banking system. </p>

        <p>Central banks implement monetary policy by controlling the money supply through several mechanisms. Typically, central banks take action by issuing money to buy bonds (or other assets), which boosts the supply of money and lowers interest rates. In the case of contractionary monetary policy, banks sell bonds and take money out of circulation. Usually monetary policy is not implemented by directly targeting the supply of money.</p>
        <p>Central banks continuously shift the money supply to maintain a targeted fixed interest rate. Some of them allow the interest rate to fluctuate and focus on targeting inflation rates instead. Central banks generally try to achieve high output without letting loose monetary policy that creates large amounts of inflation.</p>
        <p>Central banks can use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing to help increase output. Instead of buying government bonds, central banks can implement quantitative easing by buying not only government bonds, but also other assets such as corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. This allows lower interest rates for a broader class of assets beyond government bonds.</p>
        <p><span>Fiscal policy</span><br>
        Fiscal policy is the use of government's revenue and expenditure as instruments to influence the economy. Examples of such tools are expenditure, taxes and debt.</p>
        <p>For example, if the economy is producing less than potential output, government spending can be used to employ idle resources and boost output. Government spending does not have to make up for the entire output gap. There is a multiplier effect that boosts the impact of government spending. For instance, when the government pays for a bridge, the project not only adds the value of the bridge to output, but also allows the bridge workers to increase their consumption and investment, which helps close the output gap.</p>
        <p>The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out. When the government takes on spending projects, it limits the amount of resources available for the private sector to use. Crowding out occurs when government spending simply replaces private sector output. Crowding out also occurs when government spending raises interest rates, which limits investment.</p>
